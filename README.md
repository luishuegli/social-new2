# The Social Portfolio

> *An activity-first social platform designed to combat digital isolation through real-world experiences and authentic connections.*

## 🎯 Core Vision: A Strava for Life

**The Social Portfolio** is fundamentally reimagining social networking by placing activities—not followers or static profiles—at the center of human connection. We're building a platform where an individual's identity is defined by their real-world adventures and the genuine relationships that emerge from shared experiences.

This isn't another social media platform; it's a **utility for a better social life**. Your profile becomes a "Social Portfolio"—a rich, visual résumé of your life's adventures that serves as an authentic foundation for forming new connections and communities.

## 📜 Guiding Philosophy: Our Constitution

**All development must adhere to these core principles:**

### 1. **Activity is the Proof-of-Work**
- All meaningful content must be tied to a tangible activity
- We structurally reject low-effort content through an "Activity-Gated" posting mechanism
- **A post cannot exist without a defined activity behind it**

### 2. **The Individual Post is the Foundation of the Portfolio**
- Solo activity posts are the essential building blocks of authentic identity
- They serve as a "CV for your life's adventures"
- Showcase passions and skills, making users compelling candidates for joining new groups

### 3. **Shared Experience is the Highest Form of Connection**
- While solo activities build the foundation, shared experiences are the ultimate goal
- Collaborative "Live Posts" created by groups using "Activity Mode" are systematically elevated
- These represent the platform's most valuable content

### 4. **Rejecting Passive Consumption**
- We're building a utility for active participants
- Features encourage planning, doing, sharing, and connecting—not mindless scrolling
- Every interaction should move users toward real-world experiences

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## 🔐 Local admin credentials (optional)

Some local API routes (e.g., seeding utilities) use Firebase Admin to modify Firestore. Provide a service account in `.env.local` if you want to use them:

```
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID=<your_project_id>
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL=<svc>@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

Alternatively, install the Google Cloud SDK and run `gcloud auth application-default login` to enable Application Default Credentials on your machine.

## ✅ Preflight checklist before going live

- Auth
  - Enable Google in Firebase Auth and verify `localhost` and prod domain are in Authorized domains
  - `.env.local` has all `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` values and matches Firebase project
- Firestore Rules
  - Replace dev-relaxed rules with member-checked rules in `firestore.rules` (groups read restricted to members)
  - Keep chats/messages rules restricted to members
  - Review `requests`, `posts`, `polls` permissions for least privilege
- Data
  - Ensure real users are added to groups via onboarding or invite flow
  - Remove dev page `dev/add-me-to-groups`
- Admin
  - If needed, configure service account via org policy or rely on gcloud ADC on CI/servers
- Build & Deploy
  - Remove any mock/test routes, remove console logs, and run full test pass

## 🎯 Key Principles for Development

### **Activity-Gated Content**
- Every post must be associated with a real activity
- No generic "thoughts" or low-effort content
- Activity details drive the posting interface

### **Visual Hierarchy**
- Collaborative group posts > Individual posts
- Active/upcoming activities > Past activities
- Real photos/media > Text-only content

### **Authentic Identity**
- Profiles built from actual experiences
- Skills and interests demonstrated through activities
- Connection opportunities based on shared activity interests

### **Real-World Focus**
- Features should encourage offline meetups
- Digital interactions should facilitate physical experiences
- Success metrics based on real-world activity participation
